1. Write a program for Removal of duplicate Elements from an array.

Approach:

I have solved this program by using a HashSet because a set does not contain duplicate elements. 
Therefore, when you use the add method of a set, it will add only the unique elements into the set.

2. Write a program to find the third largest element from an array.

Approach:

For this problem, I have implemented a method that sorts the elements in ascending order first. Then, from the sorted array, I return the desired element. You can find other large elements by simply changing the return statement. For example, to find the second largest element, return arr[n-2], and for the fourth largest element, return arr[n-4], and so on.
